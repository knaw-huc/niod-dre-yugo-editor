            <cmdp:history xml:lang="en">"The Vukovar massacre, also known as the Vukovar hospital massacre or the Ovčara massacre, was the killing of Croatian prisoners of war and civilians by Serb paramilitaries, to whom they had been turned over by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), at the Ovčara farm southeast of Vukovar on 20 November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre occurred shortly after Vukovar's capture by the JNA, Territorial Defence (TO), and paramilitaries from neighbouring Serbia. It was the largest massacre of the Croatian War of Independence.  After several months of intense military operations between JNA and other Serb forces and Croatian forces, the Croatian forces in the area of Vukovar capitulated on 18 November 1991. Also on 18 November 1991, in Zagreb, an agreement was reached between the government of Croatia and JNA representatives for the evacuation of Vukovar hospital. Wounded or sick patients of Vukovar hospital who were “fit to make the journey” were to be evacuated to Croatia. The hospital was to be under the protection of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The evacuation was to be monitored by the European Community Monitoring Mission, who were to have full access to all stages of the evacuation. International representatives, both ECMM and ICRC, were in Vukovar on 18 and 19 November. ECMM’s access to the hospital on 18 and 19 November was prevented by the JNA. An ICRC representative was allowed only limited access to the hospital on 19 November.  On 20 November 1991 at about 0700 hours staff of Vukovar hospital were called to a meeting organised by Veselin Šljivančanin. While the meeting was in progress JNA soldiers went through the hospital and told those who were able to walk to leave. At the exit, JNA soldiers separated the men from women, children and the elderly. The men were searched by JNA soldiers, and ordered to board waiting buses under armed guard. There were over 200 men, and also two women, in this group. They were all Croat or non-Serb. They were, or were believed to have been, involved in the Croat forces. At the same time, on the other side of the hospital, the women, children and a few elderly men were gathered and boarded different buses to go to either to Serbia or Croatia.   The buses loaded with the men, prisoners from the hospital under armed guard, left the JNA barracks together and went not to Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia but to the hangar at Ovčara. They arrived there between 1330 and 1430 hours. The buses were emptied one by one and, as they were unloading a gauntlet of two rows of soldiers, about 10 to 15 on each side was formed. The prisoners had to pass between the soldiers who were beating them severely with wooden sticks, rifle-butts, poles, chains and even crutches. The prisoners of war were then forced into the hangar and remained imprisoned there under inhumane conditions until late that evening. The vast majority of the prisoners in the hangar was further severely beaten, in many cases with implements such as iron rods and rifle-butts, and kicked. Several prisoners, believed to have been prominent with the Croatian forces, were beaten particularly severely.   That evening at a time between 2000 and 2100 hours the order came from the command of Mile Mrkšić at OG South for the JNA military police guarding the prisoners of war to withdraw. They did withdraw before 2100 hours leaving the Serb Territorial Defence and paramilitary forces with unrestricted access to the prisoners. The prisoners of war were left in the custody of the Vukovar Territorial Defence who were at the time under the command of Miroljub Vujović. The prisoners were then taken by Territorial Defence and paramilitary forces in small groups to an isolated location and shot. Their bodies were buried there in a mass grave that had been dug earlier that day. The grave remained undiscovered until almost one year later, and the exhumation process did not begin until 1996. 200 bodies were exhumed. Detailed autopsies have been conducted.   Two JNA officers involved in the events following the Vukovar hospital evacuation were convicted by the ICTY - Mile Mrkšić and Veselin Šljivančanin - while Miroslav Radić was acquitted. Three other persons accused for crimes committed during or after the siege of Vukovar - Slavko Dokmanović, Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić - died before the verdict was reached in their cases.
