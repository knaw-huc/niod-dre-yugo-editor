Since 1992 HLC has worked tirelessly to document war crimes and human rights abuses and support victims and their families in achieving justice. The HLC documentation was crucial for landmark cases at the ICTY such as Foča, a pivotal case in prosecution of wartime sexual violence. When the Kosovo war started, HLC established offices there and stayed in during the NATO bombing, even when the ICRC, OSCE and international media left, reporting from Kosovo. After the wars ended, HLC turned to transitional justice. It developed a model for representing victims in domestic war crime trials, enabling the families of victims from Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo to come to trials in Serbia. Moreover, HLC has represented more than 1000 victims of human rights violations and war crimes in civil proceedings for compensation at courts in Serbia. HLC initiated the Kosovo Memory Book, a still ongoing project that documents every individual case of war-related death and disappearance in Kosovo between 1998 and 2000. Finally, HLC nurtures a regional approach to justice through RECOM – a civil society initiative to create an official regional truth commission to establish the facts about war crimes and human rights violations committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the period between 1991 and 2001. HLC has developed numerous partnerships and it is a member of Coalition for RECOM, International Coalition of Sites of Conscience and Victim Support Europe</cmd:history><cmd:geographicalAndCulturalContext xml:lang="en">Humanitarian Law Center has worked on documentation of war crimes and human rights violations since 1992. Over the years, the HLC has collected more than three million files related to the armed conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The HLC Archive stores primary materials pertaining to mass human rights violations gathered since 1992 and more than 90% of the copies of the public archive of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Among other items, the Archive contains documents from the war crimes trials held at domestic courts in Serbia and the region, media archive from the 1990s and ICTY materials, such as audio and video recordings and evidence presented at trials. The Archive is in to the continuous digitisation process. The HLC archives cover the geographical area of the former Yugoslavia, including the countries of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro.  </cmd:geographicalAndCulturalContext><cmd:administrativeStructure xml:lang="en">The work of Humanitarian Law Center encompasses documentation, justice and memory. Humanitarian Law Center supports post-Yugoslav societies in promotion of the rule of law and acceptance of the legacy of mass human rights violations, and therefore in establishing the criminal responsibility of the perpetrators, serving justice, and preventing recurrence. Realisation of these goals in the region implies going through a comprehensive and multifaceted transitional justice process. First and foremost, victims of war crimes need to fulfil their right to justice, truth, and reparation. Second, this process encompasses bringing those responsible for the crimes to court and unravelling of the institutional and state structures that were instrumental in the systematic human rights violation of the 1990s wars. Finally, awareness of the crimes that took place and giving recognition to the victims in broader society is crucial so that such crimes do not happen again. Humanitarian Law Center is organised in three pillars and implements transitional justice program through them:      Documentation     Justice     Memory  1. Documentation  Humanitarian Law Center has worked on documentation of war crimes and human rights violations since 1992. Over the years, the HLC has collected more than three million files related to the armed conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The HLC Archive stores primary materials pertaining to mass human rights violations gathered since 1992 and more than 90% of the copies of the public archive of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Among other items, the Archive contains documents from the war crimes trials held at domestic courts in Serbia and the region, media archive from the 1990s and ICTY materials, such as audio and video recordings and evidence presented at trials. The Archive is in to the continuous digitisation process.  2. Justice  The judicial pillar of Humanitarian Law Center encompasses legal representation of victims of war crimes before Serbian courts, monitoring of all war crimes trials held in Serbia, representation of victims in compensation proceedings and filing legal complaints against perpetrators of war crimes to the War Crimes Prosecutor’s Office. It also includes publication of dossiers that highlight the complicity of high-ranking members of the army and police forces in war crimes and represent a call for vetting. Finally, the judicial pillar involves policy research and advocacy for judicial and institutional reforms to enable fulfilment of the right to justice for victims.  3. Memory  Humanitarian Law Center commemorates victims through various initiatives, including public debates, documentary films and digital memory activism on social media and through other digital memory practices. In addition to commemorating victims of war crimes and mass human rights violations during the 1990s wars, memorialisation program challenges and confronts the dominant revisionist narratives about the wars, provides informal education, disseminates the judicially determined facts about the wars in an engaging way, using different media formats. The program conducts policy-oriented research and analysis as well as commentary of official memory politics in the region.</cmd:administrativeStructure><cmd:recordsManagmentAndCollectingPolicies xml:lang="en">Primary material relating to mass human rights violations which were committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and more than 90% of the copies of the Public Archive of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), have been stored in the Humanitarian Law Center’s (HLC) Archive.
